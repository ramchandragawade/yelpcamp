YelpCamp is a platform designed to facilitate campground creation and review by users. Account registration is essential for both the review and creation processes. Employing a comprehensive tech stack comprising MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, EJS, and Bootstrap, this project boasts robust functionality and a polished user interface.

Furthermore, it integrates MapBox APIs to seamlessly geocode campground locations, display them on interactive maps, and visualize all campgrounds on a global scale. Authentication management is handled seamlessly through Passport.js, ensuring secure access to platform features.

In addition, Cloudinary serves as the trusted repository for storing high-quality campground images, enhancing the visual appeal and overall user experience of the platform.

This project is a part of Colt Steele's web development bootcamp course on Udemy, reflecting its commitment to industry-leading standards and practices. Lastly, the project was successfully deployed to the production environment using Render, ensuring seamless accessibility and reliability for users worldwide.
